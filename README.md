# postman-library

This is a library of Postman files for the Mauro Data mapper.  Initially, this consists of two files:

- Mauro Data Mapper.postman_environment.json : a Postman environment with some default values for variables.
- Mauro Data Mapper.postman_collection.json : a Postman collection with folders of API configurations, with default message bodies where appropriate, with parameters that may be provided by an environment

## Getting started

Download Postman from https://www.postman.com/downloads/.

In Postman, choose File -> Import and select the files contained in this repo.
